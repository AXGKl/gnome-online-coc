# Code of Conduct

[INTENT STATEMENT]

## Our Standards

[COMMUNITY] is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of [PROTECTED CLASSES]

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

 * **Be respectful.** When we disagree, we do so in a polite and constructive manner.
 * **Be considerate.** Remember that decisions are often a difficult choice between competing priorities.
 * **Be patient and generous.** If someone asks for help it is because they need it. When documentation is available that answers the question, politely point them to it. If the question is off-topic, suggest a more appropriate online space to seek help.
 * **Try to be concise.** Read the discussion before commenting in order to not repeat a point that has been made.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

[INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR]

Community members asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

[REVERSISMS]

[WEAPONS POLICY]

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the [COMMUNITY] organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community and community events with no refund of event tickets.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone.
