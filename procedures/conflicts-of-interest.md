# Conflicts of Interest

When a new incident report is received, it's important to only involve the Code of Conduct committee members who don't have a conflict of interest. Committee members who have a conflict of interest should not have access to discussion of the report, documentation of the report, or information about who made the report.

## Definition of Conflict of Interest

Examples of conflicts of interest include:

* The reporter or reported person is your manager
* You have a romantic or platonic relationship with either the reporter or the reported person. Itâ€™s fine to participate if they are an acquaintance.
* The reporter or reported person is your metamour. (This is a term used in the poly community; the short definition is [here](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Metamour), and a longer description is [here](https://solopoly.net/2012/09/29/whats-a-metamour-on-my-terms/)).
* The reporter or reported person is your family member
* The reporter or reported person is your direct client
* The reporter or reported person is someone you work closely with. This could be someone on your team or someone who works on the same project as you.
* The reporter or reported person is a maintainer who regularly reviews your contributions

Committee members do not need to state why they have a conflict of interest, only that one exists. Other committee members should not ask why the person has a conflict of interest.

## Conflicts of Interest and New Committee Members

When a new committee member is on-boarded, they will be asked whether they have a conflict of interest with any open or closed reports. Go through the list of reported people verbally and see whether they have a conflict of interest. If not, grant them access to that report's documentation.
