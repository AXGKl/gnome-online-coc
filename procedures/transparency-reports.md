# Transparency reports

Once a quarter, the Code of Conduct committee will provide a public transparency report about the resolved and ongoing reports it has handled.

The transparency reports will remove any information about the reporter and the reported person. If there is no way to anonymize the report without revealing the identity of the reporter or the reported person, the transparency report will simply note that a report was made.

Transparency reports will include:

 * A description of how the Code of Conduct was promoted to community members
 * A summary of the total number and types of incidents that have occurred since the last transparency report
 * A summary of the resolutions to those incidents, including unresolved incidents
 * A generalized description of each incident, and how the incident was resolved

Examples of transparency reports include:

 * [PyCon United States conference 2018](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2018/06/pycon-2018-code-of-conduct-transparency.html)
