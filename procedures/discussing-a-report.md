# Discussing a report

* **Evaluate conflicts of interest.** Anyone who has a conflict of interest (as defined by the conflict of interest policy) will remove themselves from the discussion. This may mean the discussion needs to happen with a subset of committee members on an email thread, or with a subset of committee members in a private chat room.
* **Call a meeting of committee members.** Not all committee members may be able to attend the meeting, either because of a conflict of interest, or because of personal reasons. There must be at least half of the committee members who do not have a conflict of interest present in the meeting to make a decision.
* **During the meeting, discuss the reported incident** Use the evaluation techniques described below.
* **Propose behavioral modification plan.** What behavioral modification plan (if any) should be given to the reported person?
* **Propose consequences for reported person.** What (if any) actions will the committee need to take in order to ensure the behavior does not happen again? What actions will need to be taken if the reported person does not agree to the behavioral modification plan?
* **Vote on behavioral modification plan and consequences for the reported person.** Decisions will be made by a simple majority of the committee members in the meeting.

# Evaluating a report

## Jurisdiction

 * *Is this Code of Conduct violation?* Is this behavior on our list of inappropriate behavior? Does it "toe the line" of inappropriate behavior? Does it violate our community norms?
 * *Did this occur in a space that is within our Code of Conduct's scope?* If the incident occurred outside the community, but a community member's safety may be negatively impacted if no action is taken, the incident may be in scope.

## Impact

 * *Did this incident occur in a private conversation or in a public space?* Incidents that all community members can see will have more negative impact.
 * *Does this behavior negatively impact a marginalized group in our community?* Is the reporter a person from a marginalized group in our community? How is the reporter being negatively impacted by the reported person's behavior? Would members of the marginalized group decide to disengage with the community if no action was taken?
 * *Does this incident involve a community leader?* Incidents that aren't handled well can have more negative impact on overall community health.

## Risk

 * *Does this incident include sexual harrasment?*
 * *Does this pose a safety risk?* Does the behavior put a person's physical safety at risk? Will this incident severely negatively impact someone's mental health?
 * *Is there a risk of this behavior being repeated?* Does the reported person understand why their behavior was inappropriate? Is there an established pattern of behavior from past reports?

# Examples of report evaluation

## Online communities

### Correction

* *Category:* "Use of inappropriate language, such as profanity, or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community."
* *Example:* A contributor gets frustrated at another contributor and uses profanity.
* *Impact:* Occurred in a public channel. Contributor is not a community leader. Several people from marginalized groups have expressed discomfort at profanity from other community members.
* *Risk:* No safety risk, no sexual harassment. Contributor has not used profanity before. Unknown if the person understands if their behavior was inappropriate (we have not talked to them).
* *Evaluation:* High impact, low risk.
* *Consequence:* "A private, written warning from project leadership, with clarity of violation and explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public, general reminder to the whole channel that profanity is not appropriate in this community."

### Warning

* *Category:* "A violation through a single incident or series of actions that create toxicity in the community."
* *Example:* During a discussion of whether to change documentation to remove 'master/slave' terminology, a community member continued to assert that the terminology should not bother African Americans.
* *Impact:* Occurred in the public issue tracker. Negatively impacts a marginalized group in the community (African Americans). Comment was not made by a community leader.
* *Risk:* No safety risk. Community members have indicated this incident has impacted their mental health. Contributor has continued to make this assertion, despite Black community members telling them it does impact them.
* *Evaluation:* High impact, medium risk.
* *Consequence:* "A warning with consequences of continued behavior. No interaction with people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the guidelines, for a period specified by moderators. This includes avoiding interactions in any project space, as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban."

### Temporary Ban

* *Category:* "A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior or language, or targeting/harassing an individual."
* *Example:* A community member has come out as non-binary. They have asked that community members use a new name, they/them pronouns, and gender neutral language to refer to them. One community member refuses to follow that request, and ignores when other contributors correct them.
* *Impact:* Occurred in public channels. Has severely negatively impacted the mental health of transgender and non-binary community members. Does not involve a community leader.
* *Risk:* Includes targeted harassment on the basis of gender identity, but not necessarily sexual harassment. Does not pose a safety risk. Community member is likely to continue to repeat this behavior.
* *Evaluation:* High impact, medium risk.
* *Consequence:* "A temporary ban from any sort of interaction in the project community, including pull requests, issues, and comments, for a period specified by moderators. No interaction with people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the guidelines, during this period. This includes avoiding interactions in any project space, as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban."

### Permanent Ban

* *Category:* "Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior or language, harassment of an individual, or aggression or disparagement of class of individuals."
* *Example:* A community member repeatedly private messages the women in the community. They make small talk, and then ask for personal contact information. In private messages to one woman, they got very angry when the woman said she wasn't interested in dating them. They continue to contact the woman.
* *Impact:* Occurred in private messages. Is a pattern of behavior. Negatively impacts women in the community. Does not involve a community leader.
* *Risk:* The women are concerned for their safety, and the safety of other women in the community. The private messages include sexual harassment. The community member has been privately messaging women for a year.
* *Evaluation:* High impact, high risk.
* *Consequence:* "A permanent ban from any sort of interaction in the project community, including pull requests, issues, and comments, for a period specified by moderators."
