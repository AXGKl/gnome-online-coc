# Off-boarding committee members

The Code of Conduct committee members will be asked every six months if they wish to continue serving on the committee. If they wish to resign, they will be off-boarded.

If a committee member displays behavior that makes them unfit to continue serving on the Code of Conduct committee, the committee should discuss their removal. One person should email all committee members privately to discuss the person's conduct. If necessary, committee members will vote whether to remove the member. The vote must pass with a simple majority of all Code of Conduct committee members. If the vote passes, the committee chair will email the person to let them know they have been removed from the committee. Their access to committee resources should be revoked before the email is sent.

When a committee member is resigning or being removed, they should have access to the following resources revoked:

 * [FIXME this is an example list]
 * Committee mailing lists or Google groups lists
 * Aliases they use to send committee email
 * Private forums/chat servers, or private slack/Zulip channels for the committee members
 * All shared documents (such as Google Docs or private wiki pages) for reports
 * The shared spreadsheet for report statuses
 * Event registration data
