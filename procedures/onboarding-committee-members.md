# On-boarding new committee members

Should there be two or fewer committee members, additional committee members will be added.

Nominated candidates will be reviewed by the current Code of Conduct committee. Committee members vote on each candidate. Candidates will be confirmed by a a three-fourths majority of all the current Code of Conduct committee members. If a candidate was nominated by another person, the committee will confirm they are willing to be a committee member.
