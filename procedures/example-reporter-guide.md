# Attendee Procedure For Reporting Code of Conduct Incidents

[For events] **If you believe someone is in physical danger**, consult with a volunteer or staff member for the appropriate crisis number, non-emergency number, or police number.

If you believe someone has violated the [COMMUNITY] Code of Conduct, we encourage you to report it. If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We are fine with receiving reports where we decide to take no action for the sake of creating a safer community.

[For events] During the event you can make a report:
  - To a [trained] incident responder, who will be wearing [How do people identify incident responders? It could be (most effective) colorful clothing, lanyard color, or (least effective) title on badge].
  - Email [email]
  - Contact **[phone]** via voice call [or SMS], to reach one of the lead incident responders listed below.

[For online communities] You can make a report:
  - Email [email]
  - [optional] By messaging the [administrators/moderators] by [instructions for how to contact them]
  - [optional] Contact **[phone]** via voice call [or SMS]

[If providing individual contact information to allow reporters who are concerned about conflicts of interest] In the event of a conflict of interest, you may directly contact any of the lead incident responders:

  * [name]
      * [title]
      * [individual email]
      * [for events][individual phone number]

[If communities do not want to provide individual contact information, they must at least provide the names of people who will have access to report information.] Your report will be received by the following Code of Conduct committee members:

  * [name] [optionally (title)]

## Report Data

If you make a report via email or phone, please include:

* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* Date and time of the incident
* Location of incident [for online communities], including which part of the online community space it occurred in
* [For online spaces] Any links to the conversation, or logs or screenshots of the conversation
* Whether the incident is ongoing
* Description of the incident
* [For events] Identifying information of the reported person: name, physical appearance, height, clothing, voice accent, identifying badge information such as company name, ribbons, or social media handles
* [For online communities] Identifying information of the reported person: name, online username, handle, email address, or IP address
* Additional circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in or witnesses to the incident and their contact information or description

## Confidentiality

**All reports will be kept confidential**. When the [lead incident responders/Code of Conduct committee members] discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy.

However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please note those in your report. We still encourage you to report, so that we can support you while keeping our community members safe. In some cases, we can compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action on that pattern.

In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all people impacted by the behavior and the people who reported that behavior will remain confidential, unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

[If community does transparency reports] [COMMUNITY] provides transparency reports about the incidents that occurred. The transparency reports will anonymize information about the reporter and the reported person. The transparency report will include a generic description of the inappropriate behavior that occurred. If the report was not deemed to be a Code of Conduct violation, the behavior may not be mentioned. If there is no way to anonymize the report without revealing the identity of the reporter or the reported person, the transparency report will simply note that a report was made.

## Report Handling Procedure

[For events] When you make a report in-person to an incident responder, they will gather information about the incident according to the [COMMUNITY] [Procedure For Incident Response](LINK).

When you make an incident report via [email or phone], you will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 24 hours of making the report.

[If there is a centralized event CoC committee with other incident responders who take reports.] After an incident responder takes the report, they will immediately consult with the lead incident responders ([NAMES]).

If the incident is ongoing and needs to be immediately addressed, any one of the lead incident responders may take appropriate action to ensure the safety of everyone involved.

If the incident is less urgent, the three incident leads will meet within 24 hours to determine an appropriate response. Examples of possible incident responses are outlined in the [COMMUNITY] [Procedure For Incident Response](LINK). In some cases, lead responders may need to ask the person who made the report additional questions about the incident.

Before the conference, staff will have a mandatory meeting where incident response procedures will be outlined. After the conference, all incident responders will attend a debriefing session with the lead responders to discuss all incidents and determine any necessary follow-up actions.

## Conflicts of Interest

If [an incident responder/Code of Conduct committee member] has a conflict of interest for a report, they will recuse themselves from the discussion and handling of the incident. The incident documentation will not be available to them, and they will excuse themselves from any conversations involving handling the incident.

Should only two [lead incident responders/Code of Conduct committee members] need to recuse themselves, [person] ([title]) will step in as an additional decision maker on the incident.

## Following Up With Reporters

Within one week of an incident report, the [lead responders/Code of Conduct committee] will follow up with the person who made the report and provided their contact information. The follow up may include:

* An acknowledgment that the [COMMUNITY] [lead responders/Code of Conduct committee] discussed the situation
* Whether or not the report was determined to be a violation of the Code of Conduct
* What actions (if any) were taken to correcting the reporter behavior

Sometimes reports take more time to discuss or follow up on. After one week of a report being open, the person who made the report will be provided with a status update. The status update will include a time frame for when the next update will be sent or the time frame in which the report is expected to be resolved.

## Accountability

The [COMMUNITY] [lead incident responders/Code of Conduct committee members] will release public transparency reports. Transparency reports will be released [every quarter for online communities, or a short time frame (such as two weeks) after an event].

The transparency reports will remove any information about the reporter and the reported person. If there is no way to anonymize the report without revealing the identity of the reporter or the reported person, the transparency report will simply note that a report was made.

Transparency reports will include:
 * A description of how the Code of Conduct was promoted to community members
 * A summary of the total number and types of incidents that have occurred since the last transparency report
 * A summary of the resolutions to those incidents, including unresolved incidents
 * A generalized description of each incident, and how the incident was resolved
