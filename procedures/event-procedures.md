For each event under the [COMMUNITY] Code of Conduct, event organizers must provide the following information.

# Scope

What events and areas does this cover? Example areas include:

 * Event venue, during official event hours
 * Off-site at official conference evening events
 * Incidents involving physical safety that occur between attendees outside official event venues

Each organizer will provide details of the scope of the Code of Conduct for the event.

# Contact Information

 * A phone number for attendees to call
 * An email address for attendees to email
 * Names of all Code of Conduct committee members
 * (Optional) Individual contact information of incident responders (in case someone isn't comfortable reporting to a particular person)

# Means to Identify Incident Responders

Incident responders should be easily recognizable from other attendees. We recommend having incident responders wear brightly-colored shirts while they are on-shift.

# Advertisement of the Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct should be mentioned at all opening events and opening keynotes. Slides should display the URL for the Code of Conduct, the reporting number, and email address. A minimal introduction of the Code of Conduct would be:

    "[EVENT] has a Code of Conduct. We explicitly welcome all people regardless of [PROTECTED IDENTITIES]. If anyone makes you feel unwelcome, uncomfortable, or unsafe, please contact us. You can also call us at this phone number, or email us. You can also make a report in person to any of the event staff wearing [ITEM OF CLOTHING]."

# Private Reporting Room

If a reporter wants to give a report in a private space, where will incident responders take them? Ideally, no other attendees should be able to eavesdrop. It is okay if there are other event organizers around, if the event has limited private rooms.

# Decision-making Process

Events have two options for evaluating and responding to incidents.

## Centralized Decision-making

Events have some volunteers (incident responders) who are able to take an report. The incident responders than hand it off to a core group (the Code of Conduct committee) for evaluation and response. The committee should be no smaller than three people. If all but one of the committee members has a conflict of interest, there should be an additional person designated to pull in as a tie-breaker. The response to a report should never be decided by a single person.

Evaluation and decision-making is done by majority vote of the Code of Conduct committee.

## Committee Decision-making

All incident responders are part of the Code of Conduct committee that evaluates a report. Evaluation and decision-making is done by majority vote of the committee members who do not have a conflict of interest.

# Escalation Point

In the case where a reported person or reporter wants to escalate a resolved case, they should contact [HIGHER AUTHORITY].

# Plan for Immediate Response

In the case of a report about immediate physical danger, any incident responder is allowed to take steps to de-escalate the danger. Please notify the Code of Conduct committee as time allows, but be willing to act with authority if needed.

# Incident Responder Shifts

What times will incident responders be on duty? Who will answer off-shift calls about physical safety issues?

# Crisis Resources Numbers

Event organizers are required to provide the following phone numbers (in order) in their staff procedure guide:

 * Mental Health Crisis Intervention
 * Suicide Prevention Hotline
 * Alcohol Abuse Hotline
 * Sexual Assault Hotline (preferably one that supports all gender identities)
 * Health Emergency Number
 * Local police non-emergency number
 * Police Emergency Number

The hotlines should be specific to the event's location.

# Venue Security

All Code of Conduct committee members should know the number of the event venue security, but it should not be published in the staff procedure guide.
