# Committee Decision Making

When discussing a change to the Code of Conduct or enforcement policies, the Code of Conduct committee will follow this decision-making process:

* **Brainstorm options.** Committee members should discuss any relevant context and brainstorm a set of possible options. It is important to provide constructive feedback without getting side-tracked from the main question.
* **Vote.** Changes to the Code of Conduct will be decided by a three-fourths majority of all the Code of Conduct committee members.

When evaluating an incident report, the Code of Conduct committee will follow this decision-making process:

* **Call a meeting of committee members.** A meeting can be a real-time meeting or an email/forum thread. Not all committee members may be able to attend the meeting, either because of a conflict of interest, or because of personal reasons. There must be at least half of the committee members who do not have a conflict of interest present in the meeting to make a decision.
* **Vote.** Any decision involving a behavioral modification plan and consequences for the reported person must be put to a vote. Decisions will be made by a simple majority of the committee members in the meeting.

When deciding whether to add a new Code of Conduct committee member, or remove a current member:

* **Describe the new member's qualifications.** Have they served as a Code of Conduct committee member in a different community or event, or are they new to report evaluation? Are they a part of the community? Are they connected to marginalized groups in the community?
* **Call a vote.** This can be done privately, in the case of removing a current member.
* **Vote.** Changes to the Code of Conduct committee members will be decided by a three-fourths majority of all the Code of Conduct committee members.
