# GNOME online Code of Conduct committee procedures

The audience for this document is the GNOME online Code of Conduct committee. The goal of this document is to ensure that the committee consistently handles all reported Code of Conduct incidents.

[TABLE OF CONTENTS]

## Committee members

The GNOME online Code of Conduct committee has the following members:

 * Christel Dahlskjaer
 * Federico Mena Quintero
 * Felipe Borges
 * Rosanna Yuen

Please note that GNOME sysadmins have administrative access to some private committee resources. If a report is received that involves a GNOME sysadmin, all committee report discussion and documentation should occur off GNOME servers. GNOME sysadmins making a report and people reporting GNOME sysadmins are encouraged to contact committee members individually via private email. If a GNOME sysadmin accesses private committee resources, the committee will contact the GNOME Foundation board.

[CONFLICT PROCEDURES - Names of any additional people who may be pulled in if too many committee members have a conflict of interest.]

### Committee roles

The committee has one chairperson. The committee chair's duties involve:

 * Calling committee meetings
 * Contacting committee members for term renewals
 * Tracking the status of active reports

The currently acting committee chair is [PERSON].

The chair may assign a committee member, or a committee member can nominate themselves, to do the following duties:

 * Communications lead for a particular reporter, witness, or reported person
 * Communications bridge to GNOME event organizers or online moderators
 * Records keeper to ensure the committee notes related to a report are up-to-date

## On-boarding new committee members

Should there be two or fewer committee members, additional committee members will be added.

[VOTING PROCESS or APPOINTMENT?]
 * New committee members will be added through a nomination and voting process. A call for nominations will be made to a community forum or mailing list [LIST INFO]. Nominated candidates will be reviewed by the current Code of Conduct committee. Committee members vote on each candidate. Candidates will be confirmed by a a three-fourths majority of all the current Code of Conduct committee members. If a candidate was nominated by another person, the committee will confirm they are willing to be a committee member.
 * New committee members will be appointed by the community governing body or community leader. The appointment can be rejected by a three-fourths majority of all the current Code of Conduct committee members.

Confirmed committee members will be given access to the following committee resources:

 * Committee private mailing list
 * Committee private wiki pages
 * Committee private GitLab
 * [FIXME the following is an example list. Do not link to the location of the resources, but list their general nature.]
 * Private forums/chat servers, or private slack/Zulip channels for the committee members
 * All shared documents (such as Google Docs or private wiki pages) for reports
 * The shared spreadsheet for report statuses
 * Event registration data
 * Admin/moderator rights on community chat/forums

When a new committee member is on-boarded, they will be asked whether they have a conflict of interest with any open or closed reports. Go through the list of reported people verbally and see whether they have a conflict of interest. If not, grant them access to that report's documentation.

## Off-boarding committee members

Committee members shall serve for a term of one year. After one year, the committee chair will check in with the committee member. If the member confirms they wish to continue serving, their term will be renewed. If the member fails to respond to the chair request communications, they will be removed from the committee and off-boarded.

If a committee member displays behavior that makes them unfit to continue serving on the Code of Conduct committee, the committee should discuss their removal. One person should email all committee members privately to discuss the person's conduct. If necessary, committee members will vote whether to remove the member. The vote must pass with a simple majority of all Code of Conduct committee members. If the vote passes, the committee chair will email the person to let them know they have been removed from the committee. Their access to committee resources should be revoked before the email is sent.

When a committee member is resigning or being removed, they should have their access removed from the committee resources listed in the on-boarding section.

## Ratifying Code of Conduct Changes

When discussing a change to the Code of Conduct or enforcement policies, the GNOME online communities Code of Conduct committee will follow this decision-making process:

 * **Brainstorm options.** Committee members should discuss any relevant context and brainstorm a set of possible options. It is important to provide constructive feedback without getting side-tracked from the main question. Brainstorming should be limited to 3-7 days maximum.
 * **Vote.** Changes to the Code of Conduct will be decided by a three-fourths majority of all the Code of Conduct committee members
 * **Board approval.** The GNOME Foundation board will review and approve the Code of Conduct changes

## Reporting methods

Reports will come in from the email <code-of-conduct-committee@gnome.org>. This is a private mailing list with archives. It is only accessible to committee members and GNOME sysadmins.

## Conflicts of Interest

When a new incident report is received, it's important to only involve the Code of Conduct committee members who don't have a conflict of interest. Committee members who have a conflict of interest should not have access to discussion of the report, documentation of the report, or information about who made the report.

Examples of conflicts of interest include:

 * The reporter or reported person is your manager
 * You have a romantic or platonic relationship with either the reporter or the reported person. It’s fine to participate if they are an acquaintance.
 * The reporter or reported person is your metamour. (This is a term used in the poly community; the short definition is [here](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Metamour), and a longer description is [here](https://solopoly.net/2012/09/29/whats-a-metamour-on-my-terms/)).
 * The reporter or reported person is your family member
 * The reporter or reported person is your direct client
 * The reporter or reported person is someone you work closely with. This could be someone on your team or someone who works on the same project as you.
 * The reporter or reported person is a maintainer who regularly reviews your contributions

Committee members do not need to state why they have a conflict of interest, only that one exists. Other committee members should not ask why the person has a conflict of interest.

## Talking to reporters

### Talking to hesitant reporters

Sometimes a reporter may seem hesitant to meet with you or reluctant to provide details in a report. They may fear retribution. They may be worried you won’t act on the report. They may be worried that you won’t believe them. There are several different things you can do. Try them in order:

 * Reassure them that their report will remain confidential
 * Offer that they report to another member of the team, such as someone who shares their gender identity, race, or ethnicity
 * Offer to take an anonymous report. You will not record the reporter's name or contact information. Other Code of Conduct committee members will not be told the reporter's name. Unfortunately, that means they will not receive a follow-up about the report.
 * The last option if the reporter is still hesitant is to allow the reporter to "escrow" a report. They can provide a description of the incident and the Code of Conduct committee will not act on it unless the behavior is repeated. The Code of Conduct committee should review any past reports for patterns of behavior, or a pattern of behavior that pushes at the boundaries of what is inappropriate.

### Dealing with immediate danger

If there is immediate danger at an event (e.g. occurrence or threat of physical violence), ask the event organizers to call venue security, a crisis line, or other non-emergency numbers. Only call law enforcement if the person at risk asks you to.

If there is an online incident that could threaten someone's physical safety or mental health, only involve law enforcement if the person at risk asks you to. This includes situations such as stalking or sharing personal information publicly in order to encourage harassment (doxxing).

## Documenting a report

[Steps for documenting a report](https://wiki.gnome.org/CodeOfConductCommittee/Private/IncidentResponseGuidelines) are listed on a private wiki page accessible to committee members.

## Discussing a report

* **Evaluate conflicts of interest.** Anyone who has a conflict of interest (as defined by the conflict of interest policy) will remove themselves from the discussion. This may mean the discussion needs to happen with a subset of committee members on an email thread, or with a subset of committee members in a private chat room.
* **Call a meeting of committee members.** Not all committee members may be able to attend the meeting, either because of a conflict of interest, or because of personal reasons. There must be at least half of the committee members who do not have a conflict of interest present in the meeting to make a decision.
* **During the meeting, discuss the reported incident** Use the evaluation techniques described below.
* **Propose behavioral modification plan.** What behavioral modification plan (if any) should be given to the reported person?
* **Propose consequences for reported person.** What (if any) actions will the committee need to take in order to ensure the behavior does not happen again? What actions will need to be taken if the reported person does not agree to the behavioral modification plan?
* **Vote on behavioral modification plan and consequences for the reported person.** Decisions will be made by a simple majority of the committee members in the meeting.

### Evaluating a report

#### Jurisdiction

 * *Is this a Code of Conduct violation?* Is this behavior on our list of inappropriate behavior? Is it borderline inappropriate behavior? Does it violate our community norms?
 * *Did this occur in a space that is within our Code of Conduct's scope?* If the incident occurred outside the community, but a community member's mental health or physical safety may be negatively impacted if no action is taken, the incident may be in scope. Private conversations in community spaces are also in scope.

#### Impact

 * *Did this incident occur in a private conversation or in a public space?* Incidents that all community members can see will have more negative impact.
 * *Does this behavior negatively impact a marginalized group in our community?* Is the reporter a person from a marginalized group in our community? How is the reporter being negatively impacted by the reported person's behavior? Would members of the marginalized group decide to disengage with the community if no action was taken?
 * *Does this incident involve a community leader?* Incidents that aren't handled well can have more negative impact on overall community health.

#### Risk

 * *Does this incident include sexual harrasment?*
 * *Does this pose a safety risk?* Does the behavior put a person's physical safety at risk? Will this incident severely negatively impact someone's mental health?
 * *Is there a risk of this behavior being repeated?* Does the reported person understand why their behavior was inappropriate? Is there an established pattern of behavior from past reports?

## Transparency reports

Once every three months, the GNOME online Code of Conduct committee will provide a public transparency report about the resolved and ongoing reports it has handled. The committee may decide to delay a transparency report if the timing of releasing a transparency report would jeopardize the privacy of the reporter, the reported person, or third-party witnesses.

The transparency reports will remove any information about the reporter and the reported person. If there is no way to anonymize the report without revealing the identity of the reporter or the reported person, the transparency report will simply note that a report was made. If no reports have been made in the specified time period, the transparency report will state that.

Transparency reports will include:

 * A description of how the Code of Conduct was promoted to community members
 * A summary of the total number and types of incidents that have occurred since the last transparency report
 * A summary of the resolutions to those incidents, including unresolved incidents
 * A generalized description of each incident, and how the incident was resolved

Examples of transparency reports include:

 * [PyCon United States conference 2018](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2018/06/pycon-2018-code-of-conduct-transparency.html)
 * [PyCon Australia conference 2018](https://2018.pycon-au.org/news/conduct-team-transparency-report/)
 * [DjangoCon Europe conference 2018](https://2018.djangocon.eu/news/coc-transparency/)
 * [Code for America Summit 2018](https://medium.com/code-for-america/2018-code-for-america-summit-code-of-conduct-transparency-report-6e026154f39)
