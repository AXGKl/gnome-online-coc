# Ratifying Code of Conduct Changes

When discussing a change to the Code of Conduct or enforcement policies, the GNOME online communities Code of Conduct committee will follow this decision-making process:

 * **Brainstorm options.** Committee members should discuss any relevant context and brainstorm a set of possible options. It is important to provide constructive feedback without getting side-tracked from the main question. Brainstorming should be limited to 3-7 days maximum.
 * **Vote.** Changes to the Code of Conduct will be decided by a three-fourths majority of all the Code of Conduct committee members
 * **Board approval.** The GNOME Foundation board will review and approve the Code of Conduct changes
