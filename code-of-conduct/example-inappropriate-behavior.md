# Outside of Community Spaces

This code of conduct applies to [COMMUNITY] spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of [COMMUNITY] outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by [COMMUNITY] members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from [COMMUNITY] based on their past behavior, including behavior outside [COMMUNITY] spaces and behavior towards people who are not in [COMMUNITY].

# Details About Inappropriate Behavior

We want all participants in the [COMMUNITY] community have the best possible experience they can. In order to be clear what that means, we’ve provided a list of examples of behaviors that are inappropriate for [COMMUNITY] community spaces:

 * **Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following**
 * **Sustained disruption of online discussion, talks, or other events.** Sustained disruption of events, online discussions, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes ‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ event speakers or influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in event sessions. Sustained disruption also includes drinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.
 * **Harassment of people who don't drink alcohol.** We do not tolerate derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol or other substances. We do not tolerate pushing people to drink, talking about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink - physically or through jeering.
 * **Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist language or otherwise exclusionary language.** This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination.
 * **Unwelcome sexual attention or behavior that contributes to a sexualized environment.** This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. Sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Meetup organizing staff and other volunteer organizers should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
 * **Unwelcome physical contact.** This includes touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos. This also includes physically blocking or intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact (such as emojis like “kiss”) without affirmative consent is not acceptable. This includes sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text.
 * **Violence or threats of violence.** Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online. 
 * **Influencing or encouraging inappropriate behavior.** If you influence or encourage another person to violate the Code of Conduct, you may face the same consequences as if you had violated the Code of Conduct.

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.
