# Yellow Flags

The following protected classes can be signs that a community is not inclusive,
or that they are treating the Code of Conduct as a joke. If you include these
protected classes, you should add additional language in your community norms
or inappropriate behaviors sections to clarify exactly what these mean.

 * __birth__ - This is an unclear term that could possibly refer to someone's
   status at birth (e.g. caste) or something else. Use a clearer term.

 * __colour__ - This is an uncommon term to refer to a person's race
   or ethnicity. Use a clearer term.

 * __membership of a national minority__ - A "minority" simply refers to
   "The smaller in number of two groups forming a whole". As such, it could
   refer to any minority group, such as people who wear top hats vs billed caps.
   Clearer terms exist.

 * __mental illness__ - There is a lot of sigma around having depression and
   being bipolar. People are often referred to with pejorative terms like
   "insane" or "crazy". Sometimes the term "mentally ill" is used as a
   pejorative. There should be a better term to cover the intent of this
   protected class, but I'm unsure of what term should be used. Neurodiversity
   might be a better term, but I'm unclear whether it covers all the same cases.

 * __sex__ - When included, it is unclear whether this refers to gender
   identity, assigned sex at birth (which is problematic and transphobic), or
   sexual orientation. Clarification is recommended.

 * __technology choices__ - In tech, especially open source, some people are
   excluded or bullied because they choose to use technology that is seen as
   "not hardcore" or "less secure" or because they use proprietary software.
   This is sometimes referred as
   ["contempt culture"](https://blog.aurynn.com/2015/12/16-contempt-culture)
   Contempt culture and technology elitism is a serious matter to address.

   However, many communities have jokingly referenced technology elitism as a
   way to signal that they will not enforce their code of conduct. Common jokes
   include "vim vs emacs" or "tabs vs spaces". When a Code of Conduct
   references "choice of text editor", it is hard to determine if they mean it
   in a joking manner or not.

# Red Flags

The following protected classes are not recommended for inclusion in a Code of Conduct:

 * __political affiliation__ -
   [read this blog post](https://where.coraline.codes/blog/oscon/)
   for an explanation of why this is problematic.

 * __opinion__ or __diversity of opinion__ - These are commonly used terms to
   signal a Code of Conduct will not be enforced.
