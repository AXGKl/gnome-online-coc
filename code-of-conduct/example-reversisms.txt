# No Reversisms

[COMMUNITY] prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. The administrators will not act on complaints regarding:

 * "Reverse"-isms, including "reverse racism," "reverse sexism," and "cisphobia"
 * Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you."
 * Communicating in a "tone" you don't find congenial
 * Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

The examples listed above are not against the Code of Conduct.
