[1] If the incident is a major violation of the Code of Conduct, such as sexual
assault, many communities will handle a report of an incident that happens in
unofficial spaces. Some communities do not consider reports of microaggressions
(such as sexist jokes) made in unofficial spaces. Community norms may vary.
