# Photo Policy

Short version for the "Details About Inappropriate Behavior" section:

 * **Harassing photography or recording at events.** If someone says they do not want a picture or video taken of them, respect that choice. If they ask you to delete or remove a picture taken without permission, do so. Photographers (even paid event photographers) following or stalking attendees in order to get shots of a diverse group of community members is not acceptable. Some [COMMUNITY] events include three types of lanyards: photos always okay, ask if a photo is okay, or no photos. Attendees are expected to look for lanyard types and obtain permission before taking a photo or video if the "ask me" lanyard is visible. If photography permission lanyards are not present, attendees are expected to always seek permission before taking a picture. Crowd shots where attendees faces are not visible is acceptable, regardless of lanyard type. Speakers can tell event organizers if they do not want their talk recorded.
