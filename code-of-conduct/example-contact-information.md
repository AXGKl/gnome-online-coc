# Contact Types

Required:
 * a list of names and titles of the enforcement team members
 * phone number that automatically directs to any member of the enforcement team
 * alias email that directs to the enforcement team (do not use a mailing list)
 * a way to contact individual enforcement team members (ideally a contact form, so that they don't face spam and harassment of members is less easy)

Optional:
 * An anonymous reporting form
